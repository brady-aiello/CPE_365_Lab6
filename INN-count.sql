-- Q1: For each room report the total revenue for all stays and the average
--     revenue per stay generated by stays in the room that originated in
--     the months of Sept, Oct, and Nov. Sort output in desc. order by total
--     revenue.

    WHERE res.Room = rooms.RoomCode
    AND MONTH(res.CheckIn) IN (9, 10, 11)
    GROUP BY res.Room
    ORDER BY 'total revenue';
 
-- Q2: Report the total number of reservations that commenced on Fridays
--     and the total revenue they brought in. (Hint: look up the date of 
--     the first Friday on the calendar).

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'friday reservations',

    FROM rooms, reservations res

-- Q3: For each day of the week, report the total number of reservations
--     commenced on it and the total revenue these reservations brought.
--     Report days of week as Monday, Tuesday, etc.

            'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat');
 
-- Q4: For each room report the highest markup against the base price and
--     the smallest markup (i.e., largest markdown). Report markups and
--     markdowns in absolute terms (absolute difference between the base
--     price and the rate). Sort output in descending order by the absolute
--     value of the largest markup. Report full names of the rooms.

SELECT rooms.RoomName,

    GROUP BY rooms.RoomCode
    ORDER BY ABS(MAX(res.Rate - rooms.basePrice)) DESC;

-- Q5: For each room report how many nights in 2010 the room was occupied.
--     Report the room code, the full name of the room and the number of
--     occupied nights. Sort in descending order by occupied nights. (Note:
--     it has to be number of nights in 2010 - the last reservation in each
--     room may and will can go beyond December 31, 2010, so the ”extra”
--     nights in 2011 need to be deducted).
